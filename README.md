# NodeJS ARK Server Data Reader

This is a port of AuthiQ's ARK Server Data Reader into NodeJS. There might still be a few quirks, but I'm sure it will work fine.

If you wish to see how it's used, please see my NodeJS Web service https://github.com/knightzac19/NodeJS-ArkService.

----

You can help me test the library by running the following with npm

```npm install git+https://github.com/knightzac19/NodeJS-ArkData.git```

## How-To

Go to your node_modules/arkdata folder and copy the settings.json-example to your project root ./settings.json and make sure the ark path is correct.
Then you should be able to just have the following require.

```
var arkdata = require('arkdata');
var player = arkdata.player;
var tribe = arkdata.tribe;
```

This project is filled with promises and thus you just have to do this now,

```
player.setupPlayers()
	.then( () => tribe.setupTribes())
	.then( ()=> {
		 //Put all your code in here.
		});
```

## Issues

Please report any issues you have with it in the repo and hopefully we'll be able to fix them!
